# 1. Introduction

The EOSIO blockchain platform is the next-generation, open-source platform with industry-leading transaction speed and a flexible utility. As a blockchain platform, EOSIO is designed for enterprise-grade use cases and built for both public and private blockchain deployments. EOSIO is customizable to suit a wide range of business needs across industries with role-based permissions system and secure application transactions processing.

Building distributed applications on EOSIO follows familiar development patterns and programming languages used for developing non-blockchain applications. For application developers, familiarity with the development environment results in a seamless user experience as it allows developers to use their preferred development tools.

The EOSIO platform provides functionalities such as accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication, and the scheduling of applications across multiple CPU cores and clusters. These functionalities are also common in non-blockchain software development environments.

Some of the groundbreaking features of EOSIO include:
1. WebAssembly C++ Compilation
2. High Throughput and Low Latency (0.5s block time)
3. Customizeable Resource Model
4. Efficient and Flexible Persistent Data Indexing
5. Support for Human Friendy Account Names
6. Hierarchical Role Based Transparent Permissions
7. Transparent and Syncronous Smart Contract Upgradability
8. Transparent and Syncronous Protocol Upgradability
9. On-chain Governance
10. Efficient Energy Consumption
11. Webauthn and Biometric Hardware Secured Keys Support
